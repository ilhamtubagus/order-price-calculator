# Order Price Calculator

A Java project built for learning and practice, focused on calculating the final price of an order using configurable pricing rules such as fixed discounts, percentage discounts, and tax application. The project applies OOP principles to demonstrate how pricing rules can be modeled, extended, and composed in a clean and maintainable way.

## Features

- Modular pricing engine with calculation rules for discounts and taxes
- Pluggable pricing rule system (add, combine and reuse rules)
- Order and money value objects ensure safe domain modeling
- Defensive programming for input validation and immutability
- Ready for extension and unit tested
